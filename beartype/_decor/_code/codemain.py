**Beartype decorator code generator.**

This private submodule dynamically generates both the signature and body of the
wrapper function type-checking all annotated parameters and return value of the
the callable currently being decorated by the :func:`beartype.beartype`
decorator in a general-purpose manner. For genericity, this relatively
high-level submodule implements *no* support for annotation-based PEPs (e.g.,
`PEP 484`_); other lower-level submodules do so instead.

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

.. _PEP 484:
   https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484
'''

# ....................{ TODO                              }....................
#FIXME: Refactor *ALL* calls to str.replace() throughout the codebase to call a
#newly defined beartype._util.text.utiltextmunge.replace_str_substrs() function
#whose signature should resemble:
#    def replace_str_substrs(text: str, substr: str) -> str:
#
#The body of this function should:
#* If the passed string does *NOT* contain at least one instance of the passed
#  substring, raise an exception.
#* Else, return:
#      str.replace(text, substr)
#
#Why? Because the builtin str.replace() method performs *NO* such validation,
#inviting non-human-readable exceptions when we inevitably muck things up.

#FIXME: Major optimization: duplicate the signature of the decorated callable
#as the signature of our wrapper function. Why? Because doing so obviates the
#need to explicitly test whether each possible parameter was passed and how
#that parameter was passed (e.g., positional, keyword) as well as the need to
#localize "__beartype_args_len" and so on. In short, this is a massive win.
#Again, see the third-party "makefun" package, which purports to already do so.

#FIXME: Cray-cray optimization: don't crucify us here, folks, but eliminating
#the innermost call to the original callable in the generated wrapper may be
#technically feasible. It's probably a BadIdeaâ„¢, but the idea goes like this:
#
#    # Source code for this callable as a possibly multiline string,
#    # dynamically parsed at runtime with hacky regular expressions from
#    # the physical file declaring this callable if any *OR* "None" otherwise
#    # (e.g., if this callable is defined dynamically or cannot be parsed from
#    # that file).
#    func_source = None
#
#    # Attempt to find the source code for this callable.
#    try:
#        func_source = inspect.getsource(func)
#    # If the inspect.getsource() function fails to do so, shrug.
#    except OSError:
#        pass
#
#    # If the source code for this callable cannot be found, fallback to
#    # simply calling this callable in the conventional way.
#    if func_source is None:
#       #FIXME: Do what we currently do here.
#    # Else, the source code for this callable was found. In this case,
#    # carefully embed this code into the code generated for this wrapper.
#    else:
#       #FIXME: Do something wild, crazy, and dangerous here.
#
#Extreme care will need to be taken, including:
#
#* Ensuring code is indented correctly.
#* Preserving the signature (especially with respect to passed parameters) of
#  the original callable in the wrapper. See the third-party "makefun" package,
#  which purports to already do so. So, this is mostly a solved problem --
#  albeit still non-trivial, as "beartype" will never have dependencies.
#* Don't bother reading any of this. Just skip to the synopsis below:
#  * Preventing local attributes defined by this wrapper as well as global
#    attributes imported into this wrapper's namespace from polluting the
#    namespace expected by the original callable. The former is trivial; simply
#    explicitly "del {attr_name1},...,{attr_nameN}" immediately before
#    embedding the source code for that callable. The latter is tricky; we'd
#    probably want to stop passing "globals()" to exec() below and instead pass
#    a much smaller list of attributes explicitly required by this wrapper.
#    Even then, though, there's probably no means of perfectly insulating the
#    original code from all wrapper-specific global attributes. Or:
#    * Perhaps this isn't an issue? After all, *ALL* locals and globals exposed
#      to decorated callables are now guaranteed to be "__bear"-prefixed. This
#      implies that searching the body of the decorated callable for the
#      substring "\b__bear" and then raising an exception if any such
#      substrings are found should suffice to prevent name collision.
#  * Rewriting return values and yielded values. Oh, boy. That's the killer,
#    honestly. Regular expression-based parsing only gets us so far. We could
#    try analyzing the AST for that code, but... yikes. Each "return" and
#    "yield" statement would need to be replaced by a beartype-specific
#    "return" or "yield" statement checking the types of the values to be
#    returned or
#    yielded. We can guarantee that that rapidly gets cray-cray, especially
#    when implementing non-trivial PEP 484-style type checking requiring
#    multiple Python statements and local variables and... yeah. Actually:
#    * Why *CAN'T* regex-based parsing suffice? Python's Backus-Naur form (BNF)
#      is almost certainly quite constrained. We'll have to check where exactly
#      "return" and "yield" statements are permissible, but we're fairly sure
#      they're permissible only after newlines followed by sufficient
#      indentation.
#    * Note that the objects produced by Python's standard "ast" *AND* "dis"
#      modules contain line number attributes yielding the line numbers on
#      which those syntactic object were parsed. Ergo, whichever of these is
#      the more efficient almost certainly the simplest (and possibly even)
#      fastest approach. Is this worth benchmarking? Perhaps we should simply
#      adopt the "ast" approach, as that's likely to be substantially more
#      robust *AND* generalize to the case of annotated local variables, where
#      naive regexes (and probably "dis" as well) fall down. Of course, "dis"
#      is likely to be *MUCH* more space- and time-performant than "ast".
#    * *SIGH.* Yes, absolutely use the standard "ast" module. Absolutely do
#      *NOT* use either hand-rolled regexes or the standard "dis" module. Why?
#      Because:
#      * The low-level internals of the "ast" module are implemented in C. That
#        means it's likely to be fast enough for our purposes.
#      * CPython *ALREADY* has to do all (or at least, enough) of the AST
#        analysis performed by the "ast" module. Since that cost has to be paid
#        anyway, we'd might as well avoid paying additional regex or "dis"
#        costs by reusing "ast" with @beartype. Oh, wait... No, that's not how
#        things work at all. You basically can't reverse-engineer an AST from a
#        callable code object. Since Python doesn't preserve the AST it
#        internally produces to generate byte-code for a callable on that
#        callable, we have no choice but to:
#        * Get the source for that callable (e.g., with dill.source.getsource()
#          or inspect.getsource()).
#        * Pass that source string to ast.parse(). Man, that sure blows chunks.
#      * So, ignore the prior point. The only additional meaningful point is
#        that, unlike the "dis" module, the "ast" module makes it trivial to:
#        * Transform the produced AST by injecting additional nodes (e.g.,
#          dynamically generated statements) into the AST.
#        * Compile that AST down into a code object.
#      Does any of the above help us? Maybe not. All we really need from "ast"
#      and "dis" are line numbers and the ability to crudely identify:
#      * "return" statements. "dis" trivially does this.
#      * "yield" statements. "dis" trivially does this.
#      * Local annotated variable assignments. "dis" *PROBABLY* does not
#        trivially do this. Indeed, it's not necessarily clear that "ast" does
#        this either. Actually, that's absolutely *NOT* true. "ast" appears to
#        trivially detect local annotated variable assignments, which is nice.
#       Hilariously, regexes *DO* trivially detect local annotated variable
#       assignments, because that's just a search for
#       r"\n\s*[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*\s*:". Like, seriously. That's by far the
#       easiest way to do that. Detecting "return" and "yield" statements is
#       similarly trivial (we think, anyway) with regexes.
#       *WAIT.* Regexes may vary well detect the *START* of a local annotated
#       variable assignment, but they clearly fail to detect the *END*, as that
#       requires context-free parsing. Welp. That's the death-knell for both
#       regexes and "dis", then. "ast" is it!
#
#In synopsis, don't bother reading the above. Just know that parsing "return"
#and "yield" statements as well as annotated local variable assignments
#unsurprisingly requires use of the standard "ast" module. Specifically:
#* Get the source for the decorated callable. Ideally, we'll want to do so by
#  implementing our own get_callable_source() utility getter inspired by the
#  third-party "dill" implementation at dill.source.getsource() rather than the
#  standard inspect.getsource().
#* Pass that source string to ast.parse().
#* Search the resulting AST for any nodes referencing an object name (e.g.,
#  variable, callable, class) prefixed by "__bear" and raise an exception on
#  the first such node to prevent name collision.
#* Munge that AST as required.
#* Compile that AST -- ideally directly into a callable (but possibly first
#  indirectly into a code object into then that directly into a callable).
#
#I suppose we could gradually roll out support by:
#* Initially only optimizing callables returning and yielding nothing by
#  falling back to the unoptimized approach for callables that do so.
#* Then optimizing callables terminating in a single "return" or "yield"
#  statement that *DIRECTLY* return a local or global variable. This is the
#  easy common case, as we can then immediately precede that statement with a
#  type-check on that variable.
#* Then optimizing callables terminating in a single "return" or "yield"
#  statement that return an arbitrary expression. If that expression is *NOT* a
#  local or global variable, we need to capture that expression into a new
#  local variable *BEFORE* type-checking that variable *BEFORE* returning that
#  variable. So it goes.
#* Then optimizing callables containing multiple such statements.
#
#Note lastly that the third-party "dill" package provides a
#dill.source.getsource() function with the same API as the stdlib
#inspect.getsource() function but augmented in various favourable ways. *shrug*
#
#Although this will probably never happen, it's still mildly fun to ponder.
#FIXME: Actually, this should probably happen -- but not necessarily for the
#reasons stipulated above. Don't get us wrong; optimizing away the additional
#stack frame by embedding the body of the decorated callable directly into the
#wrapper function wrapping that callable is a clever (albeit highly
#non-trivial) optimization.
#
#The *REAL* tangible benefit, however, is in type-checking annotated local
#variables. Currently, neither @beartype nor any other runtime type checker has
#the means to check annotated local variables: e.g.,
#    @beartype
#    def muh_func(muh_list: list[int]) -> int:
#        list_item: int = list[0]    # <- can't check this
#        return list_item
#
#The reason, of course, is that those variables and thus variable annotations
#are effectively "locked" behind the additional stack frame separating the
#decorated callable from its wrapper function. Integrating the former into the
#latter, however, trivially dissolves this barrier; indeed, since Python
#currently has no notion of a variable decorator and prohibits function return
#values from being assigned to as l-values, there is no pragmatic alternative.
#
#The idea here is that we could augment the body of the decorated callable when
#merged into its wrapper function as follows:
#* Iteratively search that body for local annotated variable declarations.
#* For each such declaration:
#  * Inject one or more statements after each such declaration type-checking
#    that variable against its annotation.
#
#The issue here then becomes: *WHERE* after each such declaration? This is a
#pertinent question, because we could type-check a variable immediately after
#its declaration, only to have a subsequent assignment to that variable later
#in the body of the decorated callable silently invalidate the prior
#type-check. Technically, since @beartype is an O(1) type-checker, we could
#re-perform type-checks after each assignment to an annotated local variable.
#But that seems a bit heavy-handed. Perhaps we should simply inject that code
#at the last possible moment -- which is to say, immediately *BEFORE* each
#"return" or "yield" statement in that callable. We have to inject code there
#anyway to type-check that "return" or "yield" statement, so we'd be hitting
#two birds with one beating stick to additionally type-check annotated local
#variables there as well.
#
#Note that the answer to where we type-check local variables has a profound
#impact on whether we adopt a regex- or "ast"-based solution. If we type-check
#everything before "return" or "yield" statements, regex suffices. If we check
#variables immediately after their declaration or assignment, however, only
#"ast" suffices. This is, of course, yet another point in favour of checking
#everything before "return" or "yield" statements, as regex is likely to be
#substantially faster and more portable (due to changes in "ast" design and
#implementation across Python versions) than the "ast"-based approach.
#
#For example, this regex should (in theory) suffice to detect all annotated
#local variable declarations in a callable: r"\n\s+[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*\s*:".
#Oh... wait. No. Even that doesn't generalize. Why? Literal triple-quoted
#strings, obviously. Welp. "ast" it is, then! No point in beating around that
#context-free bush then, is there? Consider using the third-party "astor"
#package if available, which purportedly improves upon the standard "ast"
#module in various ways and is internally leveraged by "pylint" to perform its
#magic. In any case, Relevant articles include:
#* "Static Modification of Python With Python: The AST Module", a well-written
#  introduction to the topic:
#  https://dzone.com/articles/static-modification-python
#FIXME: Lastly, note that the above is likely to make beartype's
#decoration-time cost prohibitive under CPython, regardless of the call-time
#improvements due to stack frame compaction. Ergo, we may want to adopt the
#following defaults:
#* Under PyPy, *ENABLE* AST modification by default.
#* Under all other interpreters (especially including CPython), *DISABLE* AST
#  modification by default.
#
#Naturally, profile this to decide what we should do. To facilitate choice,
#we'll need to refactor the @beartype decorator to support a new optional
#"is_ast_modify" parameter defaulting to something resembling these defaults.
#When this parameter is false, @beartype defaults to the current approach;
#else, @beartype modifies the AST of decorated callables as above.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : BeartypeData
        Decorated callable to be type-checked.

    Returns
    ----------
    (str, bool)
        2-tuple ``(func_code, is_func_code_noop)`` where:

        * ``func_code`` is Python code defining the wrapper function
          type-checking the decorated callable, including (in order):

          * A signature declaring this wrapper, accepting both
            beartype-agnostic and -specific parameters. The latter include:

            * A private ``__beartype_func`` parameter initialized to the
              decorated callable. In theory, this callable should be accessible
              as a closure-style local in this wrapper. For unknown reasons
              (presumably, a subtle bug in the exec() builtin), this is *not*
              the case. Instead, a closure-style local must be simulated by
              passing this callable at function definition time as the default
              value of an arbitrary parameter. To ensure this default is *not*
              overwritten by a function accepting a parameter of the same name,
              this unlikely edge case is guarded against elsewhere.

          * Statements type checking parameters passed to this callable.
          * A call to this callable.
          * A statement type checking the value returned by this callable.

        * ``is_func_code_noop`` is ``True`` only if ``func_code`` proxies this
          callable *without* type-checking. Note this edge case is distinct
          from a related edge case at the head of the :func:`beartype.beartype`
          decorator reducing to a noop for unannotated callables. By compare,
          this boolean is ``True`` only for callables annotated with
          **ignorable type hints** (i.e., :class:`object`,
          :class:`beartype.cave.AnyType`, :class:`typing.Any`): e.g.,

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : BeartypeData
        Decorated callable to be type-checked.

    Returns
    ----------
    Tuple[str, bool]
        2-tuple ``(func_code, is_func_code_needs_random_int)``, where:

        * ``func_code`` is Python code type-checking the annotated return value
          declared by this callable if any *or* the empty string otherwise.
        * ``is_func_code_needs_random_int`` is a boolean that is ``True`` only

    Raises
    ----------
    BeartypeDecorHintNonPepException
        If the type hint annotating this return value (if any) of this callable

    TypeError
