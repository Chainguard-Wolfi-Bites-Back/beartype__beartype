**Beartype decorator.**

This private submodule implements the core :func:`beartype` decorator as well
as ancillary functions called by that decorator. The :mod:`beartype.__init__`
submodule then imports the former for importation as the public
:mod:`beartype.beartype` decorator by downstream callers -- completing the
virtuous cycle of code life.

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

# ....................{ TODO                              }....................
#FIXME: Avoid naively passing globals() to the exec() call below. Instead, we
#should pass a new global constant containing all "__beartype_" global imports:
#     _GLOBAL_ATTRS = {
#         '__beartype_die_unless_hint_nonpep': die_unless_hint_nonpep,
#         '__beartype_nonpep_param_exception': BeartypeCallTypeNonPepParamException,
#         '__beartype_nonpep_return_exception': BeartypeCallTypeNonPepReturnException,
#         '__beartype_pep_nonpep_exception': BeartypeCallTypePepNonPepException,
#         '__beartype_trim': trim_object_repr,
#     }
#Then refactor that exec() call to resemble:
#        exec(func_code, _GLOBAL_ATTRS, local_attrs)
#Note this is mildly faster as well, as we avoid the globals() call.

#FIXME: *CRITICAL EDGE CASE:* If the passed "func" is a coroutine, that
#coroutine *MUST* be called preceded by the "await" keyword rather than merely
#called as is. Detecting coroutines is trivial, thankfully: e.g.,
#
#    if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(func):
#
#Actually, shouldn't that be the more general-purpose test:
#
#    if inspect.isawaitable(func):
#
#The latter seems more correct. In any case, given that:
#
#* Modify the "CODE_CALL_CHECKED" and "CODE_CALL_UNCHECKED" snippets to
#  conditionally precede the function call with the substring "await ": e.g.,
#      CODE_CALL_UNCHECKED = '''
#          return {func_await}__beartype_func(*args, **kwargs)
#      '''
#  Note the absence of delimiting space. This is, of course, intentional.
#* Unconditionally format the "func_await" substring into both of those
#  snippets, define ala:
#      format_await = 'await ' if inspect.iscoroutinefunction(func) else ''
#* Oh, and note that our defined wrapper function must also be preceded by the
#  "async " keyword. So, we'll also need to augment "CODE_SIGNATURE".
#FIXME: Unit test this extensively, please.

#FIXME: Non-critical optimization: if the active Python interpreter is already
#performing static type checking (e.g., with Pyre or mypy), @beartype should
#unconditionally reduce to a noop for the current process. Note that:
#
#* Detecting static type checking is trivial, as PEP 563 standardizes the newly
#  declared "typing.TYPE_CHECKING" boolean constant to be true only if static
#  type checking is currently occurring.
#* Detecting whether static type checking just occurred is clearly less
#  trivial and possibly even infeasible. We're unclear what exactly separates
#  the "static type checking" phase from the runtime phase performed by static
#  type checkers, but something clearly does. If all else fails, we can
#  probably attempt to detect whether the basename of the command invoked by
#  the parent process matches "(Pyre|mypy|pyright|pytype)" or... something. Of
#  course, that itself is non-trivial due to Windows, so here we are. *sigh*

#FIXME: [FEATURE] Add support for unqualified classnames, referred to as
#"forward references" in PEP 484 jargon: e.g.,
#    @beartype
#    def testemall(ride: 'Lightning') -> 'Lightning': return ride
#    class Lightning(object): pass
#To do so, note that the fully-qualified name of the decorated callable is
#trivially obtainable as "func.__module__". So, this should be trivial --
#except that there exists a common edge case: *BUILTIN TYPES* (e.g., "dict"),
#which are also unqualified but signify something completely different.
#
#Fortunately, differentiating these two cases isn't terribly arduous. Note that
#the trivial expression "set(dir(builtins))", which yields a set of the names
#of all builtins, *NEARLY* gets us there. Since that set contains the names of
#builtins that are *NOT* types (e.g., sum(), super()), however, we then need to
#filter that expression for all types: e.g., something resembling:
#
#    import builtins
#    _BUILTIN_TYPE_NAMES = set(
#        getattr(builtins, builtin_name)
#        for builtin_name in dir(builtins)
#        if isinstance(getattr(builtins, builtin_name), type)
#    )
#
#I can confirm that works, but it also calls getattr() excessively. Perhaps
#there's an "inspect" function that yields not simply the names but also the
#objects defined by a passed module. *shrug*

#FIXME: Emit one non-fatal warning for each annotated type that is either:
#
#* "beartype.cave.UnavailableType".
#* "beartype.cave.UnavailableTypes".
#
#Both cases imply user-side misconfiguration, but not sufficiently awful enough
#to warrant fatal exceptions. Moreover, emitting warnings rather than
#exceptions enables end users to unconditionally disable all unwanted warnings,
#whereas no such facilities exist for unwanted exceptions.
#FIXME: Validate all tuple annotations to be non-empty *EXCLUDING*
#"beartype.cave.UnavailableTypes", which is intentionally empty.
#FIXME: Unit test the above edge case.

#FIXME: Reduce tuples containing only one item to those items as is for
#efficiency: e.g.,
#
#    # This...
#    @beartype
#    def slowerfunc(dumbedgecase: (int,))
#
#    # ...should be exactly as efficient as this.
#    def fasterfunc(idealworld: int)

#FIXME: Remove duplicates from tuple annotations for efficiency: e.g.,
#
#    # This...
#    @beartype
#    def slowerfunc(dumbedgecase: (int, int, int, int, int, int, int, int))
#
#    # ...should be exactly as efficient as this.
#    def fasterfunc(idealworld: int)
#
#Note that most types are *NOT* hashable and thus *NOT* addable to a set -- so,
#the naive heuristic of "tuple(set(hint_tuple))" generally fails.
#Instead, we'll need to implement some sort of manual pruning algorithm
#optimized for the general case of a tuple containing *NO* duplicates.
#FIXME: Ah! Actually, the following should mostly work (untested, of course):
#   tuple_uniquified = tuple({id(item): item for item in tuple}.values()}
#Mildly clever, though I'm sure I'm the one millionth coder to reinvent that
#wheel. The core idea here is that object IDs are guaranteed to be hashable,
#even if arbitrary objects aren't. Ergo, we dynamically construct a dictionary
#mapping from object ID to object via a dictionary comprehension over possibly
#duplicate tuple items and then construct a new tuple given the guaranteeably
#unique values of that dictionary. Bam! Done.
#FIXME: Actually, we have utterly no idea why we wrote "Note that most types
#are *NOT* hashable and thus *NOT* addable to a set." Classes are obviously
#hashable; ergo, "tuple(set(hint_tuple))" would seem to suffice. Alternately,
#note the comparable private typing._remove_dups_flatten() function.

#FIXME: Add support for all possible kinds of parameters. @beartype currently
#supports most but *NOT* all types. Specifically:
#
#* Type-check variadic keyword arguments. Currently, only variadic positional
#  arguments are type-checked. When doing so, remove the
#  "Parameter.VAR_KEYWORD" type from the "_PARAM_KIND_IGNORABLE" set.
#* Type-check positional-only arguments under Python >= 3.8. Note that, since
#  C-based callables have *ALWAYS* supported positional-only arguments, the
#  "Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY" type is defined for *ALL* Python versions
#  despite only being usable in actual Python from Python >= 3.8. In other
#  words, support for type-checking positional-only arguments should be added
#  unconditionally without reference to Python version -- we suspect, anyway.
#  When doing so, remove the "Parameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY" type from the
#  "_PARAM_KIND_IGNORABLE" set.
#* Remove the "_PARAM_KIND_IGNORABLE" set entirely.

#FIXME: [FEATURE] Add support for PEP 544. First, note that this PEP defines
#protocol types as classes *DIRECTLY* subclassing the new "typing.Protocol"
#abstract base class. Classes *INDIRECTLY* subclassing that class through
#transitivity are not detected as protocols. That's nice.
#
#Second, thanks to the obscure magic of abstract base classes as implemented by
#the "ABCMeta" metaclass, all classes with the "ABCMeta" metaclass provide
#highly efficient __instancecheck__() and __subclasscheck__() dunder method
#implementations by default that successfully test arbitrary objects as
#implicitly implementing an abstract base class if those objects implement all
#abstract methods declared by that base class -- even for objects whose types
#do *NOT* explicitly subclass that base class.
#
#In theory, this means that testing whether an arbitrary object "a" satisfies
#an arbitrary protocol "B" should reduce to simply:
#
#    # Yup. Really.
#    isinstance(a, B)

#FIXME: Cray-cray optimization: don't crucify us here, folks, but eliminating
#the innermost call to the original callable in the generated wrapper may be
#technically feasible. It's probably a BadIdeaâ„¢, but the idea goes like this:
#
#    # Source code for this callable as a possibly multiline string,
#    # dynamically parsed at runtime with hacky regular expressions from
#    # the physical file declaring this callable if any *OR* "None" otherwise
#    # (e.g., if this callable is defined dynamically or cannot be parsed from
#    # that file).
#    func_source = None
#
#    # Attempt to find the source code for this callable.
#    try:
#        func_source = inspect.getsource(func)
#    # If the inspect.getsource() function fails to do so, shrug.
#    except OSError:
#        pass
#
#    # If the source code for this callable cannot be found, fallback to
#    # simply calling this callable in the conventional way.
#    if func_source is None:
#       #FIXME: Do what we currently do here.
#    # Else, the source code for this callable was found. In this case,
#    # carefully embed this code into the code generated for this wrapper.
#    else:
#       #FIXME: Do something wild, crazy, and dangerous here.
#
#Extreme care will need to be taken, including:
#
#* Ensuring code is indented correctly.
#* Preserving the signature (especially with respect to passed parameters) of
#  the original callable in the wrapper. See the third-party "makefun" package,
#  which purports to already do so. So, this is mostly a solved problem --
#  albeit still non-trivial, as "beartype" will never have dependencies.
#* Preventing local attributes defined by this wrapper as well as global
#  attributes imported into this wrapper's namespace from polluting the
#  namespace expected by the original callable. The former is trivial; simply
#  explicitly "del {attr_name1},...,{attr_nameN}" immediately before embedding
#  the source code for that callable. The latter is tricky; we'd probably want
#  to stop passing "globals()" to exec() below and instead pass a much smaller
#  list of attributes explicitly required by this wrapper. Even then, though,
#  there's probably no means of perfectly insulating the original code from all
#  wrapper-specific global attributes.
#* Rewriting return values and yielded values. Oh, boy. That's the killer,
#  honestly. Regular expression-based parsing only gets us so far. We could try
#  analyzing the AST for that code, but... yikes. Each "return" and "yield"
#  statement would need to be replaced by a beartype-specific "return" or
#  "yield" statement checking the types of the values to be returned or
#  yielded. We can guarantee that that rapidly gets cray-cray, especially when
#  implementing non-trivial PEP 484-style type checking requiring multiple
#  Python statements and local variables and... yeah. I suppose we could
#  gradually roll out support by:
#  * Initially only optimizing callables returning and yielding nothing by
#    falling back to the unoptimized approach for callables that do so.
#  * Then optimizing callables terminating in a single "return" or "yield"
#    statement.
#  * Then optimizing callables containing multiple such statements.
#
#Note lastly that the third-party "dill" package provides a
#dill.source.getsource() function with the same API as the stdlib
#inspect.getsource() function but augmented in various favourable ways. *shrug*
#
#Although this will probably never happen, it's still mildly fun to ponder.

def beartype(func: CallableTypes) -> CallableTypes:
    '''
    Decorate the passed **callable** (e.g., function, method) to validate both
    all annotated parameters passed to this callable *and* the annotated value
    returned by this callable if any.

    This decorator performs rudimentary type checking based on Python 3.x
    function annotations, as officially documented by PEP 484 ("Type Hints").
    While PEP 484 supports arbitrarily complex type composition, this decorator
    requires *all* parameter and return value annotations to be either:

    * Classes (e.g., :class:`int`, :class:`OrderedDict`).
    * Tuples of classes (e.g., ``(int, OrderedDict)``).

    If optimizations are enabled by the active Python interpreter (e.g., due to
    option ``-O`` passed to this interpreter), this decorator reduces to a
    noop.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : CallableTypes
        **Non-class callable** (i.e., callable object that is *not* a class) to
        be decorated by a dynamically generated new callable wrapping this
        original callable with pure-Python type-checking.

    Returns
    ----------
    CallableTypes
        Dynamically generated new callable wrapping this original callable with
        pure-Python type-checking.

    Raises
    ----------
    BeartypeDecorHintValueException
        If any annotation on this callable is neither:

        * A **PEP-compliant type** (i.e., instance or class complying with a
          PEP supported by :mod:`beartype`), including:

          * `PEP 484`_ types (i.e., instance or class declared by the stdlib
            :mod:`typing` module).

        * A **PEP-noncompliant type** (i.e., instance or class complying with
          :mod:`beartype`-specific semantics rather than a PEP), including:

          * **Fully-qualified forward references** (i.e., strings specified as
            fully-qualified classnames).
          * **Tuple unions** (i.e., tuples containing one or more classes
            and/or forward references).
    BeartypeDecorParamNameException
        If the name of any parameter declared on this callable is prefixed by
        the reserved substring ``__beartype_``.
    BeartypeDecorPep563Exception
        If `PEP 563`_ is active for this callable and evaluating a **postponed
        annotation** (i.e., annotation whose value is a string) on this
        callable raises an exception (e.g., due to that annotation referring to
        local state no longer accessible from this deferred evaluation).
    BeartypeDecorWrappeeException
        If this callable is either uncallable or a class.

        interpreter at execution time).
