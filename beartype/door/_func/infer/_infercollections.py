'''

# ....................{ TODO                               }....................
#FIXME: Consider also adding support for standard "collections.abc" protocols.
#Doing so requires iterative isinstance()-based detection against a laundry list
#of such protocols. Note that such iteration should be performed in descending
#order from most to least specifically useful: e.g.,
#1. "collections.abc.Sequence", which guarantees random access to *ALL*
#   container items and is thus clearly the most specifically useful protocol to
#   detect first.
#2. "collections.abc.Collection", which guarantees safely efficient access of at
#   least the first container item and is thus the next most specifically useful
#   protocol to detect.
#3. "collections.abc.Container", which is largely useless but better than
#   nothing... probably. You get the incremental picture.
#
#Perform such detection *ONLY* if the class of the passed object is *NOT* a
#subscriptable generic. If the class of the passed object is a subscriptable
#generic, then such detection should clearly *NOT* be performed.
#
#The goal, ultimately, is to infer a subscriptable type hint factory. If the
#class of the passed object is *NOT* a subscriptable generic, then a suitable
#subscriptable type hint factory *MUST* be discovered through iteration.
#
#*WAIT.* That's certainly true, mostly -- but is iteration even required? Recall
#that dict.keys() view objects support efficient intersection with an arbitrary
#set of strings. Given that, the most efficient approach is actually *NOT* to
#test against protocols but rather to (in order):
#* First, decide the set of the names of all methods in the entire MRO for the
#  class of the passed object. This can probably be efficiently done with an
#  iterative reduction of, for each class in the MRO of the passed object:
#  * If this class is slotted, "cls.__slots__".
#  * Else, "cls.__dict__.keys()".
#  Note that the "object" superclass conveys *NO* meaningful semantics here and
#  thus both can and should be safely ignored. If I recall correctly,
#  "obj.__mro__[:-1]" adequately slices away the "object" superclass.
#* Next, start at the "top" of the "collections.abc" protocol hierarchy by
#  iteratively detecting whether the name of standard dunder method is in this
#  set. There exist multiple discrete "chains" of dunder methods. For example,
#  the "__contains__" dunder method is at the root of the "Container" chain.
#  This implies an iterative algorithm resembling:
#  * If "__contains__" is in this set, then this object is at least a
#    "Container". Continue testing whether...
#  * If "__iter__" and "__len__" are also in this set, then this object is at
#    least a "Collection". Continue testing downward in a similar manner.

    '''
    Type hint annotating the passed object with respect to the standard hierachy
    of abstract base classes (ABCs) published by the :mod:`collections.abc`
    subpackage.

    This function efficiently infers the narrowest :mod:`collections.abc` ABC
    applicable to the passed object by introspecting the set of all **dunder
    methods** (i.e., methods whose names are both prefixed and suffixed by the
    double-underscore substring ``"__"``). To do so, this function internally
    performs a graph theoretic traversal over a finite state machine (FSM)
    whose nodes are the set of all :mod:`collections.abc` ABCs and transitions
    between those nodes the dunder method names required by those ABCs. For
    example, given a passed object defining only the standard
    ``__contains__()``, ``__iter__()``, and ``__len__()`` dunder methods, this
    function (in order):

    #. Transitions from the start node of this FSM along the ``__contains__()``
       edge of this FSM to the corresponding :class:`collections.abc.Container`
       node.
    #. Transitions from that node along the grouped ``{__iter__(), __len__()}``
       edge of this FSM to the corresponding :class:`collections.abc.Collection`
       node.
    #. Halts there, thus inferring the type hint factory validating the passed
       object to be the :class:`collections.abc.Collection` ABC.

    Caveats
    -------
    This function exhibits:

    * Best-case constant-time complexity :math:`O(1)`, which occurs when the
      passed object satisfies *no* :mod:`collections.abc` ABC.
    * Average-case linear-time complexity :math:`O(k)` where ``k`` is the number
      of :mod:`collections.abc` ABCs subclassing the
      :class:`collections.abc.Container` superclass, which occurs when the
      passed object is a common **container** (i.e., satisfies at least the root
      :class:`collections.abc.Container` ABC).
    * Worst-case quadratic-time complexity :math:`O(jk)` where ``j`` is the
      number of :mod:`collections.abc` ABC superclasses (i.e., ABCs at the root
      of a hierarchy of ABCs) and ``k`` is the largest number of
      :mod:`collections.abc` ABCs subclassing such a superclass, which occurs
      when the passed object satisfies only an uncommon :mod:`collections.abc`
      ABC superclass.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : object
        Arbitrary object to infer a type hint from.
    __beartype_obj_ids_seen__ : FrozenSet[int]
        **Recursion guard** (i.e., frozen set of the integers uniquely
        identifying all previously visited containers passed as the ``obj``
        parameter to some recursive parent call of this same function on the
        current call stack). If the object identifier (ID) of passed object
        already resides in this recursion guard, then that object has already
        been visited by a prior call to this function in the same call stack
        and is thus a recursive container; in that case, this function
        short-circuits infinite recursion by returning a placeholder instance of
        the :class:`.BeartypeInferHintRecursion` class describing this issue.

    Returns
    -------
    object
        Type hint inferred from the passed object.

PEP-compliant type hint matching a :mod:`collections.abc` **fine state machine
(FSM)** as a dictionary whose:

* Keys describe the **transitions** (i.e., directed edges transitioning from one
  node to another) of this FSM. For both efficiency and flexibility, each
  transition is permitted to be either:

  * The name of a single **dunder method** (e.g., ``"__contains__"``). If the
    object passed to the :func:`.infer_hint_collections` function defines this
    method, then this FSM transitions to the **node** (i.e.,
    :class:`._FiniteStateMachineNode` instance) given by the value associated with
    this key in this dictionary.
  * A frozen set containing the names of two or more **dunder methods** (e.g.,
    ``frozenset({"__iter__", "__len__"})``). If the object passed to the
    :func:`.infer_hint_collections` function defines *all* of these methods,
    then this FSM performs a similar transition as in the prior case.

* Values describe the **nodes** (i.e., :class:`._FiniteStateMachineNode`
  instances) of this FSM to follow these transitions to.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint_factory : object
        Either:

        transition from this node to another node). This frozen set is a
        non-negligible optimization enabling this FSM to exhibit non-amortized
        best-case constant :math:`O(1)` time complexity. Why? Because, in the
        best case, the :func:`.infer_hint_collections` function is passed an
        object whose type defines *no* methods in this frozen set and thus
        immediately reduces to a noop.
    node_transitions : _FiniteStateMachine
        Either:

        * If this is a **stop node** of this FSM, the empty dictionary.
        * Else, this is a **transitionary node** of this FSM. In this case, this
          instance variable provides the **transition FSM** (i.e., proper subset
          of the full FSM, mapping the transitions directed out of this node to
          the neighbouring nodes those transitions transition to) of this node.
