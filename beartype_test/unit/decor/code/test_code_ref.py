**Beartype decorator forward reference unit tests.**

This submodule unit tests the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator with respect
to both PEP-compliant and -noncompliant **forward reference type hints** (i.e.,
strings whose values are the names of classes and tuples of classes that
typically have yet to be defined).
