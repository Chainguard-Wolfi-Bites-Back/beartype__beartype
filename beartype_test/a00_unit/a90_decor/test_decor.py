**Beartype decorator type hint-agnostic unit tests.**

This submodule unit tests high-level functionality of the
:func:`beartype.beartype` decorator independent of lower-level type hinting
concerns (e.g., PEP-compliance, PEP-noncompliance).

    Test coarse-grained configuration of the :func:`beartype.beartype`

    This test does *not* exercise fine-grained configuration (e.g., of
    individual type-checking strategies), which is delegated to more relevant
    tests elsewhere; rather, this test merely exercises that this decorator
    is configurable as expected from a high-level API perspective.
