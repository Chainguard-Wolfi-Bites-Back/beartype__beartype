Beartype brings Rust_- and `C++`_-inspired `zero-cost abstractions <zero-cost
abstraction_>`__ into the lawless world of `dynamically-typed`_ Python by
`enforcing type safety at the granular level of functions and methods
<Usage_>`__ against `type hints standardized by the Python community
<Compliance_>`__ in `O(1) non-amortized worst-case time with negligible constant
factors <Timings_>`__. If the prior sentence was unreadable jargon, `see our
friendly and approachable FAQ for a human-readable synopsis <Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ)_>`__.

Beartype is `portably implemented <beartype codebase_>`__ in `Python 3
<Python_>`__, `continuously stress-tested <beartype tests_>`__ via `GitHub
Actions`_ **×** tox_ **×** pytest_ **×** Codecov_, and `permissively
distributed <beartype license_>`__ under the `MIT license`_. Beartype has *no*
runtime dependencies, `only one test-time dependency <pytest_>`__, and `only
one documentation-time dependency <Sphinx_>`__. Beartype supports `all actively
developed Python versions <Python status_>`__, `all Python package managers
<Install_>`__, and `multiple platform-specific package managers <Install_>`__.

.. #FIXME: So sad! @beartype's Libraries.io listing has gone stale for nearly a
.. #year. And they've been shockingly unresponsive about this. Things seem...
.. #not all right with their service. Until they resolve whatever Python-related
.. #breakage has ruptured on their end, let's quietly disable this link and
.. #pretend this never happened. *sigh*

Install
#######

Let's install beartype with pip_:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip3 install beartype

Let's install beartype with Anaconda_:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda config --add channels conda-forge
   conda install beartype

over\ *bear*\ ing project shield. What says quality like `a bear on a badge
<Badge_>`__, amirite?

********
Platform
********

Beartype is also installable with platform-specific package managers, because
sometimes you just need this thing to work.

macOS
=====

Let's install beartype with Homebrew_ on macOS_ courtesy `our third-party
tap <beartype Homebrew_>`__:

.. code-block:: bash

   brew install beartype/beartype/beartype

Let's install beartype with MacPorts_ on macOS_:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo port install py-beartype

A big bear hug to `our official macOS package maintainer @harens <harens_>`__
for `packaging beartype for our Apple-appreciating audience <beartype
MacPorts_>`__.

Linux
=====

Let's install beartype with ``emerge`` on Gentoo_ courtesy `a third-party
overlay <beartype Gentoo_>`__, because source-based Linux distributions are the
CPU-bound nuclear option:

.. code-block:: bash

   emerge --ask app-eselect/eselect-repository
   mkdir -p /etc/portage/repos.conf
   eselect repository enable raiagent
   emerge --sync raiagent
   emerge beartype

*What could be simpler?* O_o
