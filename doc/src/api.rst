Beartype API: It Bears Bookmarking
##################################

Beartype isn't just the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator.

Beartype is a menagerie of public APIs for type-checking, introspecting, and
manipulating type hints at runtime â€“ all accessible under the ``beartype``
package installed when you installed beartype. But all beartype documentation
begins with :func:`beartype.beartype`, just like all rivers run to the sea.
[#endorheic_basins]_

.. [#endorheic_basins]
   That's a lie, actually. Numerous river tributaries just pour out into
   deserts. Do `endorheic basins`_ mean nothing to you, beartype?
